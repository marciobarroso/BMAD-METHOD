# Maven Migration Task

## Purpose

Migrate an existing Java project from an older build system (Ant, Gradle, Ivy) to Maven. Handles build system migration, dependency management, build automation, and CI/CD integration.

## When to Use

- Migrating from Ant to Maven
- Migrating from Gradle to Maven
- Migrating from Ivy to Maven
- Standardizing build systems across projects
- Improving dependency management

## Input Requirements

- Current build system details
- Project dependencies and versions
- Current build scripts and configuration
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Team preferences and requirements
- AWS deployment requirements

## Process Steps

### 1. Current Build System Analysis

- Analyze current build scripts and configuration
- Document all dependencies and versions
- Identify build processes and workflows
- Assess CI/CD integration requirements
- Evaluate team expertise and preferences
- Plan migration strategy

### 2. Maven Project Structure Creation

- Create Maven project structure
- Set up source directories
- Set up test directories
- Create package structure
- Initialize Maven configuration
- Set up Maven wrapper

### 3. Dependency Migration

- Migrate dependencies to Maven format
- Configure Maven coordinates
- Set up dependency management
- Resolve dependency conflicts
- Configure repositories
- Test dependency resolution

### 4. Build Configuration

- Create pom.xml with proper configuration
- Configure Maven plugins
- Set up build profiles
- Configure compiler settings
- Set up testing configuration
- Configure packaging and deployment

### 5. CI/CD Integration

- Update CI/CD pipeline for Maven
- Configure build triggers
- Set up test execution
- Configure artifact publishing
- Set up deployment automation
- Test CI/CD integration

### 6. AWS Integration

- Configure AWS CodeBuild for Maven
- Set up AWS CodePipeline integration
- Configure artifact storage
- Set up deployment automation
- Configure monitoring integration
- Test AWS integration
