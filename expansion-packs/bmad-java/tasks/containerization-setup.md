# Containerization Setup Task

## Purpose

Containerize an existing Java application for deployment using Docker and AWS cloud platform. Handles application modernization, containerization, orchestration setup, and cloud deployment.

## When to Use

- Migrating from application servers to containers
- Modernizing legacy Java applications
- Implementing cloud-native deployment
- Improving application portability and scalability

## Input Requirements

- Current application server details
- Application dependencies and configuration
- Deployment requirements
- AWS infrastructure preferences
- Monitoring and logging requirements
- Security requirements

## Process Steps

### 1. Application Modernization

- Remove application server dependencies
- Implement Spring Boot embedded server
- Externalize configuration
- Implement stateless design patterns
- Add health checks and metrics
- Update logging and monitoring

### 2. Docker Configuration

- Create Dockerfile for Java 21
- Implement multi-stage build
- Optimize Docker image size
- Configure security settings
- Add health checks
- Test container build

### 3. Container Optimization

- Optimize Docker image layers
- Implement security hardening
- Configure resource limits
- Set up container networking
- Implement container logging
- Test container functionality

### 4. Orchestration Setup

- Create Kubernetes manifests
- Configure deployment and services
- Set up ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Configure ingress controllers
- Set up auto-scaling
- Test orchestration

### 5. AWS Integration

- Configure AWS EKS cluster
- Set up AWS ECR repository
- Configure AWS Load Balancer
- Set up AWS monitoring
- Configure AWS security
- Test AWS integration

### 6. Deployment Automation

- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure deployment scripts
- Set up blue-green deployment
- Configure rollback procedures
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Test deployment process

## Output Deliverables
