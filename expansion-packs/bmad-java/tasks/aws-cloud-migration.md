# AWS Cloud Migration Task

## Purpose

Migrate an existing Java application to AWS cloud platform. Handles cloud architecture design, infrastructure migration, application modernization, and cloud-native deployment.

## When to Use

- Migrating from on-premise to AWS cloud
- Modernizing legacy applications for cloud
- Implementing cloud-native architecture
- Improving application scalability and reliability

## Input Requirements

- Current infrastructure details
- Application architecture and dependencies
- AWS service preferences
- Security and compliance requirements
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Cost optimization requirements

## Process Steps

### 1. Cloud Strategy Planning

- Analyze current infrastructure and application
- Design AWS cloud architecture
- Select appropriate AWS services
- Plan migration strategy (Lift & Shift, Replatform, Refactor)
- Assess costs and benefits
- Plan security and compliance

### 2. Application Cloud Preparation

- Implement cloud-native patterns
- Externalize configuration
- Implement secrets management
- Add health checks and metrics
- Implement distributed logging
- Update error handling

### 3. AWS Infrastructure Setup

- Configure AWS VPC and networking
- Set up AWS compute services (EC2, ECS, EKS)
- Configure AWS database services (RDS, Aurora)
- Set up AWS storage services (S3, EBS)
- Configure AWS security services (IAM, Security Groups)
- Set up AWS monitoring services (CloudWatch)

### 4. Data Migration
